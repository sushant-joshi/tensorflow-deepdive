1. Prepare the Data. 
    - PyTorch provides the Dataset class that you can extend and customize to load your dataset.
    - PyTorch provides the DataLoader class to navigate a Dataset instance during the training and evaluation of your model.
2. Define the Model.
    - The idiom for defining a model in PyTorch involves defining a class that extends the Module class.
3. Train the Model.
    - The training process requires that you define a loss function and an optimization algorithm.
        - loss functions - Cross Entropy Loss, BCE, MeanSquaredLoss
        - optimization techniques - SGD, Adam
    - Each Epoch has the following steps 
        - Clearing the last error gradient.
        - A forward pass of the input through the model.
        - Calculating the loss for the model output.
        - Backpropagating the error through the model.
        - Update the model in an effort to reduce loss.
4. Evaluate the Model.
    - Compare predictions vs target data and compute eval metrics 
5. Make Predictions on unseen data
    - This requires that you wrap the data in a PyTorch Tensor data structure. A Tensor is just the PyTorch version of a NumPy array for holding data. It also allows you to perform the automatic differentiation tasks in the model graph, like calling backward() when training the model. The prediction too will be a Tensor, although you can retrieve the NumPy array by detaching the Tensor from the automatic differentiation graph and calling the NumPy function.
